Write a function to parse a VCF file and extract basic variant information.
Implement a script to calculate allele frequencies from a VCF file.
Create a function to filter variants based on quality scores.
Write a program to identify variants that are unique to one sample when comparing multiple VCF files.
Implement a function to annotate variants with their predicted effect (e.g., synonymous, missense, nonsense).
Create a script to generate a consensus sequence from a reference genome and a VCF file.
Write a function to calculate transition/transversion ratio from a set of variants.
Implement a program to identify regions of high variant density in a genome.
Create a function to convert genomic coordinates to gene-relative coordinates for a given set of variants.
Write a script to simulate a simple variant calling process, including generating mock read data with errors.
Implement a function to detect potential structural variants using a read-pair approach. The function should identify read pairs with abnormal insert sizes or orientations.
Create a simple machine learning model (e.g., using scikit-learn) to classify variants as benign or pathogenic based on features like conservation scores and allele frequencies.
Develop a script to simulate the process of returning genetic results to participants, considering factors like variant pathogenicity, clinical actionability, and participant consent preferences.
Implement a basic population stratification analysis to identify potential biases in a variant dataset, considering different ethnic groups or populations.
Create a function to anonymize genetic data by replacing personally identifiable information with hash codes while preserving the ability to link related records.
