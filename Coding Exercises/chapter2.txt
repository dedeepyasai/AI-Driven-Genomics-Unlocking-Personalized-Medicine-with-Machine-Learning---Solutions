Write a function to parse a VCF file and extract basic variant information.
Implement a script to calculate allele frequencies from a VCF file.
Create a function to filter variants based on quality scores.
Write a program to identify variants that are unique to one sample when comparing multiple VCF files.
Implement a function to annotate variants with their predicted effect (e.g., synonymous, missense, nonsense).
Create a script to generate a consensus sequence from a reference genome and a VCF file.
Write a function to calculate transition/transversion ratio from a set of variants.
Implement a program to identify regions of high variant density in a genome.
Create a function to convert genomic coordinates to gene-relative coordinates for a given set of variants.
Write a script to simulate a simple variant calling process, including generating mock read data with errors.
