Write a function to identify known pharmacogenomic variants in a patient's genetic data.
Implement a script to calculate a drug response score based on multiple genetic markers.
Create a function to predict potential drug-drug interactions based on a patient's genotype.
Write a program to classify patients into metabolizer categories (e.g., poor, intermediate, normal, rapid) for a specific drug.
Implement a function to generate a report of personalized drug recommendations based on genetic data.
Create a script to identify potential adverse drug reactions based on a patient's genetic profile.
Write a function to calculate the frequency of pharmacogenomic variants in a population dataset.
Implement a program to predict drug dosage adjustments based on genetic factors.
Create a function to identify genes involved in the metabolism of a given drug.
Write a script to simulate a clinical trial outcome based on participants' genetic profiles.
Develop a function that queries a pharmacogenomic database (like PharmGKB) using their API to retrieve information about gene-drug interactions for a given drug.
Create a script that simulates a regulatory compliance check for a pharmacogenomic test, including patient consent verification and adherence to reporting guidelines.
Implement a more advanced clinical decision support tool that integrates multiple pharmacogenomic guidelines (e.g., CPIC, DPWG) and provides dosing recommendations based on a patient's genetic profile.
Write a program that analyzes the cost-effectiveness of implementing pharmacogenomic testing for a specific drug, considering testing costs, potential adverse event prevention, and improved efficacy.
Develop a script that simulates the integration of pharmacogenomic data into an electronic health record system, including alerts for potential gene-drug interactions.
