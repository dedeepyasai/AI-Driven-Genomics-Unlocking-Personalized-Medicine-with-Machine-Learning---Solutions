Implement a script to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between two conditions.
Create a function to visualize DNA methylation patterns as a heatmap.
Write a program to classify CpG islands based on their methylation status.
Implement a function to integrate DNA methylation data with gene expression data.
Create a script to perform peak calling on ChIP-seq data for histone modifications.
Write a function to calculate the enrichment of histone modifications around transcription start sites.

Create a function to predict enhancer regions based on histone modification patterns.
Write a script to simulate DNA methylation data for a set of genomic regions.
Implement a function to perform peak calling on ATAC-seq data and visualize the distribution of peaks relative to transcription start sites.
