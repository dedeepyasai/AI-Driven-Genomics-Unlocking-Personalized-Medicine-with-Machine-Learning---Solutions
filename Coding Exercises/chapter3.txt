Write a function to predict the amino acid change caused by a single nucleotide variant.
Implement a script to classify variants as coding or non-coding based on their genomic location.
Create a function to identify variants that fall within known regulatory regions (e.g., promoters, enhancers).
Write a program to calculate the SIFT score for missense variants (you may simulate the score calculation).
Implement a function to determine if a variant causes a frameshift in a coding sequence.
Create a script to annotate variants with their associated gene names using a gene coordinate file.
Write a function to predict the impact of splice site variants on intron-exon boundaries.
Implement a program to identify variants that create or destroy transcription factor binding sites.
Create a function to calculate the conservation score for a genomic position across multiple species.
Write a script to integrate annotations from multiple sources (e.g., gene impact, conservation, regulatory regions) for each variant.
Implement a machine learning model (e.g., Random Forest) to predict variant pathogenicity using features like conservation scores, allele frequencies, and protein impact scores. Use scikit-learn and evaluate the model's performance.
Create a function that integrates data from multiple omics layers (e.g., genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics) to provide a comprehensive annotation for a given variant. Use pandas for data manipulation and numpy for numerical operations.
Develop a visualization function that creates a lollipop plot showing the distribution and impact scores of variants along a gene sequence. Use matplotlib for plotting.
Implement a deep learning model using keras or pytorch to predict variant effects directly from DNA sequences. Include both convolutional and recurrent layers in your architecture.
Create a function that performs dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA or t-SNE) on multi-omics data and visualizes the results, coloring points by variant pathogenicity. Use scikit-learn for dimensionality reduction and seaborn for visualization.
